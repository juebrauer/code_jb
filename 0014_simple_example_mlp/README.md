# Overview

`01_mlp_artifical_data.ipynb`

This is a minimal MLP Jupyter notebook example that shows how to train a MLP to approximate a linear or non-linear function f(x)=y using just examples. The MLP is implemented using PyTorch.


`02_mlp_autoscout24.ipynb`

This is another Jupyter notebook example that shows how to build a MLP model that learns to predict the price of a car using historical data of used cars.

The dataset used here is the [Germany Used Cars Dataset 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wspirat/germany-used-cars-dataset-2023) which is quite dirty and needs a lot of previous cleaning work!
