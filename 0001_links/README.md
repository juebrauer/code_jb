- [Example 1: SVMs map features to high-dimensional space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method) - The vectors are not explicitly mapped to a high-dimensional feature space.
Instead, the Kernel trick computes the similarity of vectors in that feature space using a Kernel function that operates in the original space.
